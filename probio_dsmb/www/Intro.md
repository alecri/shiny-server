This interactive web-app was designed to illustrate the features of the ProBio study using simulated examples under different scenarios:  
- scenario 1: no treatment works better in any signature  
- scenario 2: one treatment (Carboplatin) works better (HR = 0.5) 
- scenario 3: one treatment (Carboplatin) works better (HR = 0.4) only in the disease subtype belonging to the signature DRD+  
- scenario 4: hormonal therapies work better in the signature TP53- & AR-, Carboplatin in the signature DRD+, while chemotherapies work better in the signature TEfus+ with HR ranging from 0.4 to 0.27.
